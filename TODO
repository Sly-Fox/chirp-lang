The 401 (Unauthorized) response message is used by an origin server
   to challenge the authorization of a user agent. This response MUST
   include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing at least one
   challenge applicable to the requested resource. 

2 Basic Authentication Scheme

For Basic, the framework above is utilized as follows:

      challenge   = "Basic" realm
      credentials = "Basic" basic-credentials

   Upon receipt of an unauthorized request for a URI within the
   protection space, the origin server MAY respond with a challenge like
   the following:

      WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="WallyWorld"

   where "WallyWorld" is the string assigned by the server to identify
   the protection space of the Request-URI. A proxy may respond with the
   same challenge using the Proxy-Authenticate header field.

   To receive authorization, the client sends the userid and password,
   separated by a single colon (":") character, within a base64 [7]
   encoded string in the credentials.

      basic-credentials = base64-user-pass
      base64-user-pass  = <base64 [4] encoding of user-pass,

      user-pass   = userid ":" password
      userid      = *<TEXT excluding ":">
      password    = *TEXT

   Userids might be case sensitive.

   If the user agent wishes to send the userid "Aladdin" and password
   "open sesame", it would use the following header field:
